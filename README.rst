Rapidpro Community Portal
==========================

Below you will find basic setup and deployment instructions for the rapidpro_community_portal
project. To begin you should have the following applications installed on your
local development system::

- Python >= 3.4
- `pip <http://www.pip-installer.org/>`_ >= 1.5
- `virtualenv <http://www.virtualenv.org/>`_ >= 1.10
- `virtualenvwrapper <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenvwrapper>`_ >= 3.0
- Postgres >= 9.1
- git >= 1.7


Getting Started
------------------------

First clone the repository from Github and switch to the new directory::

    git clone git@github.com:rapidpro/rapidpro-community-portal.git
    cd rapidpro-community-portal

To setup your local environment you should create a virtualenv and install the
necessary requirements::

    mkvirtualenv rapidpro-community-portal -p /usr/bin/python3.8
    $VIRTUAL_ENV/bin/pip install --find-links=file://$PWD/requirements/sdists -r $PWD/requirements/dev.txt

Then create a local settings file and set your ``DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE`` to use it::

    cp rapidpro_community_portal/settings/local.example.py rapidpro_community_portal/settings/local.py
    echo "export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=rapidpro_community_portal.settings.local" >> $VIRTUAL_ENV/bin/postactivate
    echo "unset DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE" >> $VIRTUAL_ENV/bin/postdeactivate

Exit the virtualenv and reactivate it to activate the settings just changed::

    deactivate
    workon rapidpro-community-portal

Create the Postgres database and run the initial migrate, which will also execute any required migrations::

    createdb -E UTF-8 rapidpro_community_portal
    python manage.py migrate

You should now be able to run the development server::

    python manage.py runserver


Deployment
------------------------

You can deploy changes to a particular environment with
the ``deploy`` command::

    fab staging deploy


Refreshing Staging Environment
--------------------------------------

The staging environment can be refreshed from current production via::

    fab staging refresh_environment

This command will take a dump of the current production database, ship it to staging, and
install it there. Furthermore the media tree will be sync'd from production to staging, and the
database migrated (since staging may have more recent code than produciton).

After this command completes, go to https://rapidpro-staging.cakt.us/admin/sites/1/ and replace
the production domain name with rapidpro-staging.cakt.us.
